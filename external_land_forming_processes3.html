                <div class="slide" data-title="Weathering">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Section 1: Weathering</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Weathering is the foundational process of <strong>denudation</strong>, a term for all external processes that wear down the Earth's surface. It is specifically defined as the mechanical disintegration (physical breaking) and chemical decomposition (chemical decay) of rocks <em>in situ</em>. The term <em>in situ</em> is critical, as it means the rock is broken down in its original place, without being moved by agents like wind or water. The layer of loose, weathered rock material that results is called <strong>regolith</strong>.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.1 Factors Influencing Weathering</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Temperature and moisture are the main climatic drivers. Hot, humid climates accelerate chemical weathering, as chemical reactions are faster at higher temperatures and water is a key reactant. Arid regions with large diurnal (daily) temperature ranges experience intense physical weathering.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nature of the Rock:</strong> A rock's mineral composition, texture, color, and structure determine its resistance. For example, rocks with minerals like quartz are very resistant, while those with calcite (like limestone) are susceptible to chemical weathering. Well-jointed rocks have more surface area exposed to weathering processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Living Organisms:</strong> Plant roots can exert immense pressure as they grow into rock crevices (physical). Decomposing organic matter produces acids that enhance chemical weathering. Burrowing animals also expose rock to air and water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Topography:</strong> The steepness of a slope affects the rate of weathering. On very steep slopes, weathered material is removed quickly by gravity, exposing fresh rock faces to attack. On gentle slopes, a thick layer of regolith can accumulate, which may insulate the bedrock and slow down the weathering rate.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.2 Types and Processes of Weathering</h3>

                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Physical (Mechanical) Weathering</h4>
                    <p class="mb-2">This is the breakdown of rock into smaller fragments without altering its chemical makeup. It is dominant in deserts and high-altitude areas.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Exfoliation:</strong> Common in arid regions with large temperature swings. The outer layers of a rock heat up and expand during the day, then cool and contract at night. This repeated stress, applied to a rock that is a poor conductor of heat, causes the outer layers to fracture and peel off, like the layers of an onion. This process creates large, rounded landforms called <strong>exfoliation domes</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Block Disintegration:</strong> Occurs in well-jointed rocks. Temperature fluctuations cause the entire rock mass to expand and contract, which pries apart the rock along existing joints and bedding planes, breaking it into large, angular blocks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Granular Disintegration:</strong> Affects rocks composed of different minerals (e.g., granite). Each mineral expands and contracts at a different rate, creating internal stresses that cause the rock to crumble grain by grain into a coarse, sandy material.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frost Action (Freeze-Thaw):</strong> Highly effective in cold, mountainous regions. Water enters cracks in a rock, and when it freezes, it expands by about 9% in volume. This expansion acts as a powerful wedge, widening the crack. Repeated cycles of freezing and thawing eventually shatter the rock.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pressure Release (Unloading):</strong> Rocks formed deep within the Earth's crust (like granite) are under immense pressure. When the overlying material is eroded away over millions of years, this pressure is released, causing the rock to expand and crack in large, curved sheets parallel to the surface.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Chemical Weathering</h4>
                    <p class="mb-2">This involves the decomposition of rock minerals through chemical reactions, resulting in the formation of new substances. It is most active in warm, moist climates.</p>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> The simple process where water, a universal solvent, dissolves certain rock minerals. Rock salt and gypsum are extremely soluble and can be completely dissolved.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oxidation:</strong> The reaction of oxygen (usually dissolved in water) with minerals. It is essentially the "rusting" of rocks and is most common in those containing iron. The iron compounds are changed into iron oxides, which are reddish-brown and crumble easily.</li>
                        <li><strong>Carbonation:</strong> Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, forming a weak carbonic acid ($H_2O + CO_2 \rightarrow H_2CO_3$). This acid is very effective at dissolving rocks that contain calcium carbonate, such as limestone and chalk, converting it into soluble calcium bicarbonate ($H_2CO_3 + CaCO_3 \rightarrow Ca(HCO_3)_2$), which is then carried away in solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hydrolysis:</strong> A chemical reaction between water and minerals. For instance, feldspar in granite reacts with water and is converted into kaolin (clay), a much softer material.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> The process where certain minerals absorb water into their structure, causing them to swell and create internal stresses that lead to the rock's disintegration.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Biological Weathering</h4>
                    <p class="mb-2">This is weathering caused by the actions of plants and animals. It can be both physical and chemical.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Plants:</strong> Tree and plant roots can grow into cracks and joints in rocks, and as they grow larger, they exert pressure, forcing the rock apart.</li>
                        <li><strong>Animals:</strong> Burrowing animals (like rodents, rabbits, and termites) create tunnels that expose new rock surfaces to air and water, accelerating weathering.</li>
                        <li><strong>Humans:</strong> Activities like mining, quarrying, and road construction involve large-scale excavation and breaking of rocks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- Slide 2: Mass Wasting -->
                <div class="slide hidden" data-title="Mass Wasting">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Section 2: Mass Wasting</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Mass wasting, or mass movement, is the downhill movement of a large mass of weathered rock material (regolith) and soil, primarily driven by the force of gravity.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.1 Factors Influencing Mass Wasting</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> The fundamental force that pulls material downslope.</li>
                        <li><strong>Angle of Slope:</strong> The steeper the slope, the greater the component of gravity pulling material downwards, making movement more likely and faster.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Content:</strong> Water adds significant weight to soil and regolith. It also fills pore spaces, reducing the internal friction that holds particles together, thereby acting as a lubricant and promoting failure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vegetation:</strong> Plant roots bind soil and loose rock together, increasing the stability of a slope. The removal of vegetation through deforestation or fire significantly increases the risk of mass wasting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tectonic Activity:</strong> Ground shaking during earthquakes or volcanic eruptions can dislodge vast amounts of material, triggering catastrophic landslides and rockfalls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Human Activities:</strong> Excavations for roads, buildings, and mines can over-steepen slopes. Loading slopes with waste material or buildings can also increase stress and trigger movement.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.2 Types of Mass Wasting</h3>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Slow Mass Wasting</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Soil Creep:</strong> A very slow, almost imperceptible downhill movement of soil and regolith. While not dramatic, it can cause significant long-term damage. Evidence includes tilted trees, fences, and utility poles; bent tree trunks; and small, step-like ridges on hillsides called <strong>terracettes</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solifluction:</strong> A specific type of creep that occurs in cold, high-latitude or high-altitude environments. During summer, the top layer of soil thaws and becomes saturated with water, but the ground underneath remains frozen (permafrost). This saturated layer then flows slowly downhill over the frozen ground.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Rapid Mass Wasting</h4>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Landslides:</strong> A general term for the rapid movement of rock and debris. Key types include:
                            <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                                <li><strong>Slumping:</strong> A rotational movement where a mass of rock and regolith slides down a concave, curved surface.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rockslides:</strong> Occur when a block of bedrock breaks loose and slides down a slope.</li>
                                <li><strong>Debris Slides:</strong> Similar to a rockslide, but involves unconsolidated material.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mudflows:</strong> A rapid flow of soil, rock debris, and a large amount of water. They are common in semi-arid regions where intense but infrequent rain can saturate loose surface material. Volcanic mudflows, composed of ash and water, are known as <strong>lahars</strong> and are extremely dangerous.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rockfall:</strong> The free-fall of individual rocks from a steep cliff or slope. This is the fastest type of mass movement.</li>

                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Erosion Processes</h4>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li><strong>Hydraulic Action:</strong> The sheer force of moving water dislodges loose material from the river's bed and banks. In rapids and waterfalls, the compressed air forced into cracks can have an explosive effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Abrasion (Corrasion):</strong> The river's load (sediment) acts as sandpaper, scraping and grinding the channel. This is the most effective form of river erosion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Attrition:</strong> Transported rocks and pebbles collide with each other, breaking down into smaller, smoother, and more rounded particles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution (Corrosion):</strong> The chemical action of the water dissolving soluble minerals from the rocks that form the river's banks and bed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Transportation Processes</h4>
                     <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li><strong>Traction:</strong> Large boulders and rocks are rolled along the riverbed by the force of the water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Saltation:</strong> Smaller pebbles and gravel are bounced or hopped along the riverbed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> Fine, light material like clay and silt is held up and carried along within the main flow of the water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Dissolved minerals are carried invisibly in the water as a chemical solution.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Deposition</h4>
                    <p>A river deposits its load when it loses energy. This occurs when the river's velocity decreases due to a reduction in gradient, a decrease in water volume (e.g., during a dry season), or when it enters a body of still water like a lake or the sea.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.2 Landforms of River Erosion (Upper Course)</h3>
                    <p>In its upper course, a river has a steep gradient and its energy is primarily directed towards vertical (downward) erosion.</p>

                        <li><strong>Meanders:</strong> Wide, sweeping bends formed as the river erodes laterally. Erosion is concentrated on the outer bank (forming a river cliff), while deposition occurs on the inner bank (forming a slip-off slope).</li>
                        <li><strong>Ox-bow Lakes:</strong> Crescent-shaped lakes formed when a river cuts through the narrow neck of a meander during a flood, abandoning the old loop, which is then sealed off by deposition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Floodplains:</strong> The wide, flat valley floor on either side of a river, built up over time by the deposition of fine sediment (alluvium) during repeated floods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Levees:</strong> Raised banks along the sides of the river channel, formed by the deposition of the coarsest material during floods when the river first breaks its banks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deltas:</strong> A low-lying tract of alluvial deposits formed at the mouth of a river where it enters a sea or lake.

                                <li><strong>Plucking (Quarrying):</strong> Meltwater freezes in cracks in the bedrock. As the glacier moves, it pulls or "plucks" large rock fragments away.</li>
                                <li><strong>Abrasion:** The rock debris embedded in the base and sides of the glacier acts like sandpaper, scratching and grinding the bedrock. This creates polished surfaces and long scratches called <strong>striations</strong>.</li>

                        <li><strong>Deposition:</strong> When a glacier melts, it deposits its load. Glacial deposits, known as <strong>till</strong> or <strong>boulder clay</strong>, are characteristically unsorted, meaning they are a mixture of all particle sizes.</li>

How does the process of saltation work in wind transportation?</summary><div><p>Medium-sized sand particles are lifted by wind, travel a short distance, and then fall back to the ground, dislodging other particles in a hopping motion.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>111. What is the significance of a wave-cut platform in terms of coastal change?</summary><div><p>It is direct evidence of coastal erosion and cliff retreat over a long period.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>112. Explain how a spit can become a bar.</summary><div><p>If a spit continues to grow across the mouth of a bay due to longshore drift and eventually reaches the other side, it becomes a bar.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>113. Why are fjords often much deeper inland than at their mouths?</summary><div><p>Because the glacier that carved the fjord was thickest and had the most erosive power further up the valley. A deposit of terminal moraine at the mouth also creates a shallower sill.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>114. How does a lack of vegetation contribute to the formation of wadis?</summary><div><p>Without vegetation to bind the soil and slow down runoff, occasional intense rainfall can cause powerful flash floods that easily erode deep, steep-sided channels.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>115. What are the key differences between a V-shaped valley and a U-shaped valley?</summary><div><p>A V-shaped valley is formed by a river and has steep sides. A U-shaped valley is carved by a glacier, which widens, deepens, and straightens a former river valley, giving it a flat bottom and very steep sides.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>116. Define attrition and explain where it occurs in both river and coastal environments.</summary><div><p>Attrition is the process where transported rock fragments collide with each other and break down. In rivers, it happens as the load is carried downstream. At the coast, it occurs as waves move sediment back and forth.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>117. What is an oasis and how does it relate to wind erosion?</summary><div><p>An oasis is a fertile spot in a desert where water is found. It can form in a deflation hollow, which is a depression created by wind erosion that has reached the underground water table.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>118. What is the difference between a stalactite and a stalagmite?</summary><div><p>A stalactite is an icicle-like formation of calcium carbonate that hangs from the roof of a cave. A stalagmite grows upwards from the cave floor.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>119. How can tectonic activity influence mass wasting?</summary><div><p>Earthquakes can shake and destabilize large areas of rock and soil on slopes, triggering landslides, rockfalls, and debris slides.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>120. Why does a river meander in its middle and lower course?</summary><div><p>The gradient is gentler, so the river flows more slowly and begins to erode laterally (sideways) rather than vertically, creating wide bends.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>121. What is the source of the material that forms moraine?</summary><div><p>It comes from rock weathered from the valley sides that falls onto the glacier, and from rock that is plucked and abraded from the valley floor and sides by the ice itself.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>122. How are beaches formed?</summary><div><p>They are formed by the deposition of sand and shingle by constructive waves, which have a strong swash that moves material up the shore and a weak backwash that leaves it there.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>123. What is the significance of joints and bedding planes in weathering?</summary><div><p>They are lines of weakness in a rock that allow water, air, and plant roots to penetrate, greatly accelerating both physical and chemical weathering processes.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>124. What is the relationship between a floodplain and levees?</summary><div><p>A floodplain is the wide, flat area of alluvium on either side of a river. Levees are the raised banks along the river channel itself, formed by deposition during floods that spread across the floodplain.</p></div></details>
                        <details><summary>125. Why is Karst scenery typically associated with a lack of surface drainage?</summary><div><p>Because limestone is a soluble but impervious rock with many joints. Rainwater quickly dissolves the rock along these joints and disappears underground, forming a subterranean drainage system rather than surface rivers.</p></div></details>
