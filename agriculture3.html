                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Definition of Agriculture</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Agriculture is defined as the science and art of growing crops and rearing livestock. It is a fundamental human activity that forms the backbone of economies and societies worldwide, providing food, raw materials, and employment.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Importance of Agriculture in Kenya</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Provides employment opportunities for a significant portion of the population, both directly on farms (e.g., weeding, harvesting) and indirectly in related industries (e.g., processing, transport).</li>
                        <li><strong>Foreign Exchange:</strong> Earns the country vital foreign exchange through the export of cash crops like tea, coffee, and horticultural products, which is used to finance imports and development projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Industrial Raw Materials:</strong> Supplies raw materials for a wide range of industries, including food processing (e.g., sugar, flour), textiles (cotton), and manufacturing (e.g., vegetable oils).</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> The need to transport agricultural goods from farms to markets stimulates the development of infrastructure such as roads, railways, and storage facilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Income Generation:</strong> Provides income for farmers, raising their living standards, promoting rural development, and reducing poverty.</li>
                        <li><strong>Market for Industries:</strong> Creates a ready market for industrial products, including farm inputs like fertilizers, pesticides, machinery (tractors, combine harvesters), and packaging materials.</li>
                         <li><strong>Food Security:</strong> Ensures the nation has a stable supply of food, reducing reliance on imports and enhancing national sovereignty.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="slide hidden" data-title="Factors Influencing Agriculture">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Factors Influencing Agriculture</h2>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Climatic Factors</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Rainfall:</strong> Amount and reliability are crucial. High rainfall (1300-1800mm) is needed for tea, while moderate rainfall (635-1145mm) suits maize.</li>
                        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Affects crop growth rates, fruit ripening, photosynthesis, and transpiration. Tea requires cool to warm temperatures (18-24°C), while sugarcane prefers higher temperatures (20-27°C).</li>
                         <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High relative humidity is essential for certain tropical crops like cocoa and oil palm.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Topographic (Relief) Factors</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Altitude:</strong> Different crops have optimal altitude ranges. Tea and coffee thrive in the Kenyan highlands (1000-2200m), while rice, cotton, and sugarcane are lowland crops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slope (Gradient):</strong> Lowlands and gently rolling terrain are ideal as they facilitate cultivation and mechanization. Steep slopes are prone to soil erosion and are difficult to farm.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Edaphic (Soil) Factors</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Soil type, fertility, depth, and drainage are critical. Different crops require specific soil types. For instance, tea grows best in deep, fertile, acidic volcanic soils, while sugarcane thrives in alluvial or black cotton soils.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Biotic Factors</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">The presence or absence of beneficial organisms (like pollinators) and harmful ones (like parasitic plants, insect pests, and diseases) significantly influences the type of agriculture that can be successfully practiced in an area.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Social and Economic Factors</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Social Factors:</strong> Cultural traditions, land ownership systems (e.g., individual vs. communal), religion (e.g., prohibition of pig farming in some cultures), and traditional diets all influence farming practices and crop choices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> These include the operational costs (farm inputs), marketing expenses, price fluctuations in local and global markets, government policies (such as subsidies and taxes), and international trade agreements that set quotas or tariffs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="slide hidden" data-title="Types of Agriculture">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Types of Agriculture</h2>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
                        <li><strong>Simple Subsistence Farming (Shifting Cultivation):</strong> This is the growing of food crops primarily for the family's needs. It is characterized by the "slash and burn" method of clearing virgin forests, the use of simple tools like hoes, mixed cropping (planting multiple crops in one plot), and field rotation. As population pressure increases and land tenure systems change, this practice is becoming less common.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sedentary Subsistence Agriculture:</strong> In this system, farmers remain permanently in one location. They practice crop rotation to maintain soil fertility and may combine food crop cultivation with cash crops and the rearing of animals for supplementary food and income.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intensive Subsistence Farming:</strong> Characterized by high energy input (labor and resources) per unit area to sustain a large population. It is often dominated by a single staple crop, such as wet paddy rice in Asia or other food crops like wheat and maize in other densely populated regions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plantation Farming:</strong> This is a specialized, large-scale commercial cultivation of a single cash crop (monoculture) on extensive estates. It is characterized by scientific management, high capital investment, use of hired labor, and production mainly for export.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extensive Mechanized Grain Cultivation:</strong> This involves large-scale, highly mechanized cultivation of grains, particularly wheat. It is common in temperate grasslands like the prairies of Canada and is also practiced in parts of Kenya such as Narok and Uasin Gishu.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mediterranean Agriculture:</strong> An intensive and highly specialized form of farming found in regions with Mediterranean climates. It typically combines orchard farming (citrus fruits, olives), viticulture (grape cultivation for wine), and the cultivation of cereals and vegetables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mixed Farming:</strong> This is an integrated system that combines the growing of crops and the rearing of livestock on the same farm, creating a symbiotic relationship where animal manure fertilizes the crops, and crop residues can be used as animal feed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Tea Farming</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Growing Areas:</strong> Concentrated in the Western Highlands (Kericho, Nandi, Kakamega) and Eastern Highlands (Nyeri, Murang'a, Kirinyaga, Embu, Meru).</li>
                        <li><strong>Ideal Conditions:</strong> High rainfall (1300-1800mm) well-distributed, warm temperatures (18-24°C), high altitude (1000-2200m), and deep, fertile, well-drained acidic volcanic soils.</li>
                        <li><strong>Processing Steps:</strong> Involves withering (reducing moisture), rolling (crushing leaves), fermentation (developing flavor and color), drying (halting fermentation), and grading (sorting by size).</li>
                        <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Primarily handled by the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA), which assists small-scale farmers with inputs, collection, and marketing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Pests (black tea thrip) and diseases (root rot), poor feeder roads delaying transport, climatic hazards like hailstorms, and fluctuations in world market prices.</li>

                        <li><strong>Growing Areas:</strong> Dominated by the Western Kenya Sugar Belt (Mumias, Nzoia) and the Nyanza Sugar Belt (Chemelil, Awendo, Muhoroni), with some cultivation at the coast (Ramisi).</li>
                        <li><strong>Ideal Conditions:</strong> High temperatures (20-27°C), high and well-distributed rainfall (1200-1500mm), and deep, fertile alluvial or black cotton soils on gently sloping lowlands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Processing Steps:</strong> The harvested cane is crushed to extract raw juice, which is then filtered, boiled with lime to crystallize, and refined to produce sugar. Important by-products include bagasse (used as fuel) and molasses (used for industrial alcohol).</li>
                        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Stiff competition from cheaper sugar imports, pests and diseases, delayed payments to farmers by factories, and occasional fire outbreaks destroying mature cane.</li>
