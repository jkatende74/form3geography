                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Defining Soil: Beyond Dirt</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Soil is scientifically defined as the uppermost layer of loose and unconsolidated material that overlies the Earth's crustal rocks and on which plants grow. Far from being inert dirt, soil is a dynamic, living ecosystem. It is a complex mixture of four primary components: inorganic mineral matter, organic matter (humus), soil water, and soil air. The intricate interplay of these components creates the medium that sustains terrestrial life. The soils of any region, including Kenya, are a direct legacy of its geological and climatic history, which in turn dictates its agricultural potential and economic activities.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Critical Significance of Soil</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">The importance of soil extends far beyond agriculture. It is a cornerstone of both ecological stability and economic prosperity. Soil provides physical anchorage for plant root systems, acts as a vast reservoir of water and nutrients, and serves as a habitat for a staggering diversity of microorganisms essential for nutrient cycling. Economically, soils are fundamental, providing building materials and forming the basis of agriculture, which is vital for food security, employment, and national economies like Kenya's.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.1 The Foundational Process: Weathering</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">The journey of soil formation begins with weathering, the in-situ (in place) mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of parent rock. This breaks down solid rock into regolith, the primary mineral constituent of soil. Key weathering processes include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Physical Weathering:</strong> Breakdown without chemical change, including exfoliation, block/granular disintegration, frost action, and pressure release.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chemical Weathering:</strong> Alteration of the rock's mineral composition, including hydrolysis, carbonation, and oxidation. This is dominant in warm, humid climates like Kenya's highlands.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.2 The Biological Engine: Organic Matter and Humus</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Living organisms profoundly influence soil formation. The decomposition of plant and animal remains leads to the formation of <strong>humus</strong>, a stable form of organic matter vital for fertility, structure, and water retention. This process, driven by microorganisms, involves two stages:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Mineralization:</strong> The initial breakdown of organic tissues into simpler substances.</li>
                        <li><strong>Humification:</strong> The re-synthesis of these simpler substances into complex, stable humus molecules.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.3 Vertical Movement: Leaching and Translocation</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">As water moves through the soil, it transports materials vertically, creating distinct layers or horizons. This includes:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Leaching:</strong> The chemical removal of soluble minerals from upper soil layers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eluviation:</strong> The physical washing down of fine mineral particles (like clay) in suspension.</li>
                        <li><strong>Illuviation:</strong> The accumulation of these leached and eluviated materials in lower soil layers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.4 The Five Factors of Soil Formation (CLORPT)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">The final character of any soil is the result of the complex interplay of five major factors over time: <strong>Cl</strong>imate, <strong>O</strong>rganisms, <strong>R</strong>elief, <strong>P</strong>arent Material, and <strong>T</strong>ime.</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Soil Texture:</strong> Refers to the proportion of sand, silt, and clay particles. It influences water retention, aeration, and root penetration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Soil Structure:</strong> Describes how soil particles are grouped into aggregates or "peds". Good structure allows for proper air and water circulation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Soil Color:</strong> Provides clues about composition. Dark soils often indicate high humus content, red/yellow soils suggest iron oxides and good drainage, while grey/mottled colors imply poor drainage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Soil Depth:</strong> The thickness of the soil layer above the parent rock, influenced by weathering, topography, and time.</li>

                        <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> The amount of pore space within a soil, determining its capacity to hold air and water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Permeability:</strong> The ease with which water can move through the soil. Sandy soils are highly permeable, while clay soils have low permeability.</li>
