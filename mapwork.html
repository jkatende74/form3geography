                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Section 1: The Fundamentals of Maps</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Mapwork is the study and practice of interpreting and using maps. A map is a two-dimensional, scaled representation of the Earth's surface, or a part of it, showing physical and human-made features. For the KCSE syllabus, the primary focus is on <strong>topographical maps</strong>, which are detailed maps showing landforms (relief), drainage, vegetation, and cultural (human) features.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.1 Marginal Information: The Map's Metadata</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Before reading a map, one must understand its marginal information—the details provided in the map's border or "margin". These essentials provide context and are crucial for accurate interpretation.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Title and Sheet Name:</strong> Tells you the specific area the map covers (e.g., "EAST AFRICA 1:50,000 (KENYA)," with a sheet name like "KARATINA").</li>
                        <li><strong>Sheet Number and Series:</strong> A unique identifier for the map sheet (e.g., Sheet 121/3).</li>
                        <li><strong>Publisher and Copyright Date:</strong> Indicates who created the map (e.g., Survey of Kenya) and when, which helps in assessing its currency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Shows the relationship between a distance on the map and the corresponding distance on the ground.</li>
                        <li><strong>Key (or Legend):</strong> Explains the meaning of all the conventional signs and symbols used on the map.</li>
                        <li><strong>Directional Information:</strong> Includes details on True North, Grid North, and Magnetic North, along with the magnetic variation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contour Interval:</strong> States the vertical distance between adjacent contour lines.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.2 Conventional Signs and Symbols</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">These are the standardized symbols used to represent real-world features on a map. They are the "language" of the map and must be learned by referencing the key.</p>

                        <li><strong>Direction:</strong> The position of one place relative to another, often expressed using the 16 cardinal points of a compass (N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>Bearing:</strong> A more precise measurement of direction given as an angle in degrees, measured clockwise from North.</li>

                        <li><strong>True North:</strong> The direction to the Earth's geographic North Pole.</li>
                        <li><strong>Grid North:</strong> The direction of the vertical grid lines (Eastings) on a map. It's often assumed to be the same as True North in exercises.</li>
                        <li><strong>Magnetic North:</strong> The direction a compass needle points. It changes over time.</li>

                        <li>Place a protractor with its baseline along the North-South line and its center at the starting point.</li>
                        <li>Measure the angle clockwise from the North line to the line connecting the two points. This angle is the bearing, expressed in three figures (e.g., 045°, 259°).</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">This system allows for the precise location of any feature on a topographical map using a grid of numbered horizontal and vertical lines. The rule is to "Read Right, then Up".</p>

                    <p class="mb-2">Used to locate a grid square.</p>

                        <li>Read the number of the Easting that forms the left side of the square.</li>
                        <li>Read the number of the Northing that forms the bottom side of the square.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A square bounded by Easting `34` and Northing `56` has a grid reference of `3456`.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Six-Figure Grid Reference</h4>
                    <p class="mb-2">Used to pinpoint a specific feature *within* a grid square.</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li>Find the four-figure reference for the grid square.</li>
                        <li>Mentally divide the square into 10 smaller vertical divisions. Estimate how many tenths "right" from the Easting the feature is. This is the 3rd digit.</li>
                        <li>Mentally divide the square into 10 smaller horizontal divisions. Estimate how many tenths "up" from the Northing the feature is. This is the 6th digit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A school in grid square `3456`, located 7-tenths to the east and 2-tenths to the north, has a six-figure reference of `347562`.</li>

                        <li><strong>Representative Fraction (RF) or Ratio Scale:</strong> A ratio where the numerator (always 1) represents map distance and the denominator represents ground distance in the same units (e.g., 1:50,000 means 1 cm on the map is 50,000 cm on the ground).</li>
                        <li><strong>Linear Scale:</strong> A graduated line or bar for direct measurement of distance on the map.</li>

                        <li><strong>Straight-Line Distance:</strong> Measure with a ruler and convert using the scale. (e.g., 8 cm on a 1:50,000 map = $8 \times 0.5 \text{ km} = 4 \text{ km}$).</li>
                        <li><strong>Curved-Line Distance:</strong> Use the edge of a piece of paper, pivoting along the curve. Measure the marked length on the paper and convert using the scale.</li>

                                <li>Add the full and partial counts to get the total number of squares.</li>
                                <li>Multiply the total squares by the area of one grid square (e.g., on a 1:50,000 map, one square is 1 km²).</li>
